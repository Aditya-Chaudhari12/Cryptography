# Cryptography
Cryptography is the science of encoding and securing information to protect it from unauthorized access. It enables secure communication, data integrity, and authentication by transforming readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) and back again when needed.

### Core Objectives (CIA Triad):

Confidentiality – Ensures that only authorized parties can access the data.  
Integrity – Prevents unauthorized modification of data.  
Availability – Ensures that authorized users have access to the data when needed.  

## Types of Cryptography
### Symmetric Cryptography (Private-Key Cryptography)

•  Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.  
•  Fast and efficient for encrypting large amounts of data.  
•  Requires a secure way to share the key between sender and receiver.  
•  Example algorithms: AES, DES, 3DES.

### Asymmetric Cryptography (Public-Key Cryptography)

•  Uses a pair of keys: a public key (for encryption) and a private key (for decryption).  
•  No need to share private keys, making it more secure than symmetric encryption for key distribution.  
•  Slower than symmetric encryption due to complex mathematical operations.  
•  Example algorithms: Diffie-Hellman, RSA.
